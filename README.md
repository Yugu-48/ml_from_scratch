# ml_from_scratch
Implementing core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy, with strong mathematical foundations.
1]Phase 1: NumPy Fundamentals
- Array creation & operations
- Reshape, shape, ndim
- Axis & broadcasting
- Indexing & slicing
- Boolean indexing
- Random data & train/test split
2]Phase 2: Pandas Data Handling
- CSV reading & inspection
- Data cleaning (missing values, duplicates)
- Boolean filtering
- Feature engineering
- Groupby & aggregation

3]Phase 3: Deep Learning (In Progress)
- Neural networks basics
- Keras model building
- Loss & optimizer understanding
- Vertex AI workshop preparation

Currenlty learning:-
Mathematical foundations for ML.
Deep Learning using Keras & TensorFlow  
Preparing for hands-on workshop with Vertex AI.


This repository documents my journey of learning Machine Learning 
from scratch — focusing on understanding concepts deeply rather 
than just calling library functions.
